##Events
###$.publish() - method

Public High-level Method to broadcast the message to all subscribers.

Method takes a string as a parameter and it represents a topic id of event.
publish() has no limitations to the number of parameters sent to the subscriber's eventHandler function.
Example with parameters

publish( topic: string, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)

    publish( topic: string, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)

topic 	- is a string representation of event.
arg1...n 	- can be any type. Unlimited number of arguments.
Returns: void

###$.publish(object) - method

Public High-level Method to broadcast the message to all subscribers.

Method takes one parameter which is an object with some configuration parameters.
publish() has no limitations to the number of parameters sent to the subscriber's eventHandler function.
Example with parameters

publish( {topic: string, system: bool, module: bool}, arg 1, arg2, arg3, ...)

    publish( {topic: string, system: bool, module: bool}, arg 1, arg2, arg3, ...)

object 	- {topic: string, system: bool, module: bool}.

topic is a string representation of event.

system defines whether system events should be included into broadcast. This is handy parameter for inter-module event pub/sub communication. Default is true.

module defines whether or not module events should be included into broadcast. If set to false, can be used for system events of the core Application. This is really handy option for creating/extending the main application with internal system modules/events. All inner working of the framework use module = false for internal communication.
arg1...n 	- can be any type. Unlimited number of arguments.
Returns: void

###$.subscribe() - method

API High-level Method to subscribe to the event.
Topic and eventHandler are two required parameters

subscribe() can pass none, single or multiple parameters to eventHandler.
Example with parameters

subscribe( topic: string, eventHandler: function())
subscribe( topic: string, eventHandler: function(param))
subscribe( topic: string, eventHandler: function(param1, param2, ...))

    subscribe( topic: string, eventHandler: function(param1, param2, ...))

topic 	- string representation of topic id
eventHandler 	- functions that handles event when topic is published
Returns: object

        - object {topic: string, uid: string, system: bool} or false. Returning false from the event handler will prevent any additional subscriptions from being invoked and will cause publish() to return false. 

###$.subscribe() - method

API High-level Method to subscribe to the event.

Topic and eventHandler are two required parameters, options object is optional:
subscribe() can pass none, single or multiple parameters to eventHandler.
Example with parameters

subscribe( topic: string, eventHandler: function(param1, param2, ...), options: {context: this, priority: 10, system: false, data: object{key:value} })

    subscribe( topic: string, eventHandler: function(param1, param2, ...), options: {context: this, priority: 10, system: false, data: object{key:value} })

topic 	- string representation of topic id
eventHandler 	- functions that handles event when topic is published
options 	- {context: null, priority: int, system: bool}

context: The value of "this" when the event handler is called. Often there is a need to operate within a context for a subscription callback. It can be a reasonable strategy to have the context be set to a jQuery object that will be used inside of the subscription, or even a native DOM element. Default is module instance.

priority: Priority relative to other subscriptions for the same message. Lower values have higher priority. Subscribing to a topic with high priority can be useful as an error handler or anytime data may need to be checked or augmented before proceeding. Default is 10.

system: Defines if it is system event or not. All internal events of the framework have system event set to true. All module events have system set to false. It' is useful for separation of module and system eventing and is done to prevent unsubscribe() method used trough module API from unsubscribing essential system events from global event stack. By the same time, if system module is created this must be set to true. Only system module can unsubscribe system events. Default is false.

data: This parameter sends additional key-value object to the event. This can be used as a static unmodifiable configuration data structure. An example for usa case would be when event is created inside of the module, module creates static field '_module_' : module name', which is used for module look up, when only id of the subscription is known.
Returns: object

        - object {topic: string, uid: string, system: bool} or false. Returning false from the event handler will prevent any additional subscriptions from being invoked and will cause publish() to return false. 

###$.unsubscribe() - method

Topic and uid are two required parameters.
Third parameter "system" is optional and used to remove system events. Default is false.

Removes all events from module. Useful when destroying module.

    unsubscribe( )

Removes all events from module. Useful when destroying module.

    unsubscribe( module: string)

    unsubscribe( Array: [
    {topic: string, uid: string, system: bool},
    {topic: string, uid: string, system: bool},
    {topic: string, uid: string, system: bool}
    ] )
    unsubscribe( Array: [
    {topic: string, uid: string},
    {topic: string, uid: string},
    {topic: string, uid: string}
    ] )
    unsubscribe( Array: [
    module: string,

    module: string
    ] )
    unsubscribe( Array: [
    topic: string,

        - config 

###AppCore.config() - method

Add new app-config object.

This is shared object available between all modules and events in the app. Even though config can be extended at any time, this is strongly discouraged. Best practices dictate that commonly shared object must be declared constant and any data interaction/modification should be and can be achieved through event message passing. Such approach will help to avoid any possible race conditions and stuff that is generally hard to debug.

This method creates static, non-mutable object, which is declared right after AppCore autostart but before creation of any AppCore.module(s).

###$.getContainer() - method

Get the reference to the DOM Collection of the module.

Must be set prior with setContainer. When module is created Core searches module name amongst DOM elements. If it finds DOM element with exact name it will set the binding between module and DOM element otherwise it keeps it undefined and can be set latter with setContainer() if needed.

    $.getContainer()

Returns: object

        - domObject 

###$.setContainer() - method

Bind Dom elements to the module. Creates Dom association with the module. This method helps to associate DOM object with the module. Normally you would make a DOM element called for example #shoppingCart and associate it with module "shoppingCart". The module "shoppingCart" becomes responsible for any functionality associated with of DOM representation.

    $.setContainer()

new_Container 	- by default it uses querySelectorAll, or if jQuery is present on the page it will use it by default. In any case css type selectors are supported.
Returns: object

        - domObject 

##Console
###$.console - object

Log the message to the console from the module.

Due to diffident implementations of console in Firefox and Webkit browsers, line numbers are getting messed up in Webkits, but correct in Firefox. Webkits use proto for all methods, this is the reason why they cannot be reassigned to Api variables and should be used via apply. @param message string;

    $.log(object[, object, ...])
    $.info(object[, object, ...])
    $.warn(object[, object, ...])
    $.error(object[, object, ...])

        - Prints values of important system variables to console. 

##System
###AppCore.setSelectorEngine() - method

Set selector engine in the AppCore.

jQuery, Zepto or any other selector engines can be used. Simply pass the reference to the desired Selector engine and it becomes available in All modules through api. If jQuery is present on the page it is automatically selected as default selector Engine. Only one selector engine can be specified / active at the time.

    AppCore.setSelectorEngine('jquery', jQuery);

name 	- name reference, which is used across the application. For jQuery use 'jquery'.
engine 	- reference to selector engine. Default jQuery.

    AppCore.isRunning('name');

pageID/moduleID 	- string. Name of the page/module.
Returns: boolean

##Extend
###AppCore.extendApi() - method

Extends Facade Api available in the module.

This method should be used to add new methods and properties to the Api. Api is passed to the module as a first argument e.g AppCore.module("module_name", function(Api) {}). Default Api consist of small but essential set of features, just enough to get started on the new big thing. Due to the fact that each and every project is individual, this Api should be adjusted and extended on per project bases. Api itself is created in modular way and can be copied across to the new project.

    //1. set selector engine:
    AppCore.setSelectorEngine('jquery', jQuery);
    //Note: jQuery is default selector engine. If jQuery is included in the page, it will be set as default selector engine automatically and this step can be skipped.
    //2. Extend the Api:
    AppCore.extendApi({
    find : function (selector) {
    return this.getContainer().find(selector);
    }
    }, 'jquery');

new_object 	- - Api object that should be added to the api.
dependency 	- string. Optional. Used in conjunction with selector engine. If api methods depend on specific selector engine, dependency should be specified to the name of that engine. It helps to protect the code from possible errors. Errors occur when new methods of the api try to access some functionality of non-specified / non-registered selector engine. If dependency is specified it will check if it's active and only then extend the Api. If dependency does not match the selector engine, the Api will not be extended with the newly declared methods.
Returns: void

###AppCore.extend() - method

Extends AppCore . This method should be used to add new methods and properties to the AppCore.

    AppCore.extend({
    find : function (selector) {
    return this.getContainer().find(selector);
    }
    });

new_object 	- Api object that should be added to the core AppCore.
